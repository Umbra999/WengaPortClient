Its my very old Client and it got skidded and leaked by DayOfThePlay and other useless Skids so i just release it
Its very old anyways so i dont care about it

Thanks to my Bro Kyuzo (Evolve Engine) for helping me a lot with UI Stuff <3
Also thanks for love whos helping me at my current client

Message to Day: You are a Skid and claim everything you stole from someone and heres the proof i made these methods before you stole them like the skid you are.
Message to the German Map people: I had a lot of fun crashing yall and i still hate everyone of them, whoever said i log tokens heres the proof, nothing changed since 5 Months.
Message to other Skids: If you Skid my stuff atleast give credits, its old code anyways and hella unoptimized and badly coded, it was just made to annoy gang monkeys
Message to Stellar: You litteraly decompiled loves client and call it your own and tell him a skid, please get a brain stellar. everyone knows you cant code at all.

Never buy Astronya, DayClient or any other trash. Just make it by yourself or use Clients which actually help you and not these "gang" trash with probably tokenlog you.
